# pms‑app Launch Press Kit

This one‑pager provides an overview of pms‑app for journalists, bloggers and potential users.  It can be included in emails or published on your website.

## About pms‑app

**pms‑app** is a modern, local‑first password manager and secure note vault.  Built with Expo and React Native, it lets you store and organise sensitive data entirely on your device.  Your secrets are encrypted using strong cryptography (`expo-secure-store` and `tweetnacl`) and protected by your master passphrase or biometrics.  Optional zero‑knowledge backups allow you to keep an encrypted copy in your own cloud storage.  There are **no ads**, **no analytics**, and **no trackers**.

### Key Features

* **Local‑first architecture** – your vault lives on your device; no central servers.
* **Strong encryption** – secrets are encrypted at rest and in backups using modern cryptography.
* **Biometric unlock** – use Face ID, Touch ID or fingerprint to access your vault quickly and securely.
* **Zero‑knowledge backups** – optionally back up your encrypted vault to a cloud provider of your choice.  You hold the keys; we cannot decrypt your data.
* **Simple, intuitive UI** – add, edit and search passwords and secure notes with ease.  Dark mode support out of the box.
* **Cross‑platform** – available on iOS and Android with consistent experience.

### Value Proposition

pms‑app is designed for users who want the security of a password manager without trusting a third‑party service with their secrets.  By keeping your data local and giving you control over encrypted backups, it offers maximum privacy with minimal compromise.  There is no subscription fee for core functionality; optional features may be offered as a one‑time in‑app purchase.
